This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 where a missing route can lead to unexpected behavior.  The issue occurs when you have a URL path that doesn't have a matching route defined in your Routes component.  This can result in either the wrong component rendering or a routing error.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code, while `AppSolution.js` provides the solution.

This is a common mistake for developers new to React Router v6, and this example helps illustrate best practices for handling missing routes.
